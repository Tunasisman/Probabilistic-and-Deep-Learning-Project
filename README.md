# Probabilistic and Deep Learning Project

This repository contains my **Probabilistic and Deep Learning (PADL)** project submission.  
The project explores modern probabilistic modeling and deep learning methods to solve complex learning problems, combining theory-driven probabilistic reasoning with deep neural architectures.

## 🎯 Objective

The aim of this project is to:
- Apply **probabilistic modeling** to real-world or simulated datasets.
- Build and train **deep learning architectures** (e.g., feedforward, CNNs, or probabilistic networks).
- Evaluate model performance under uncertainty.
- Compare traditional and probabilistic deep learning techniques.

## Tools and Libraries

This project is implemented in **Python 3** and leverages the following packages:

- `numpy` — numerical computations  
- `pandas` — data manipulation and preprocessing  
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn` — visualization  
- `torch` (PyTorch) — deep learning models and training  
- `torchvision` — datasets and transforms  
- `scikit-learn` — metrics, preprocessing, and baselines
